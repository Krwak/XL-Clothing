This mod modifies winter clothing for mutants and adds a few new pieces where required. 
It also buffs XL variants of armors to have the same protection values as standard armors.

Stockings and wool stockings for arms and legs got their warmth changed to 10 and 30 respectively.
XL winter boots, XL socks, XL wool socks and XL balaclava added for those huge mutants.
Added XL variants of leg warmers, arm warmers, long underwear bottom and top.
Skim mask made to accomodate abnormally mutated anatomy.
Wool foot rags have lower encumbrance.
